Program verification is a grand challenge in computer science with significant practical impact. 
The difficulty of this problem due in great part to several complex common constructs of conventional programming languages~\cite{ClarkeJS05}, e.g., concurrent execution of threads, pointers with unbounded heap size, function call with recursions, and unbounded/large basic data types. It is unlikely to develop a verification algorithm that handles all of these constructs. Very commonly, researches on program verification focus on only a few of these constructs and have simplified assumptions on the rest. Moreover, the verification tools become more and more unmanageable with the increased number of constructs they support. Updating the existing verification tools to include new solutions dealing with more program constructs is normally a nightmare for the developers.

In the paper, we propose a loosely-coupled approach to enable existing intraprocedure analyzers the capability of handling recursive functions.
