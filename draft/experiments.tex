For the evaluation of our work, we used all 23 benchmarks, 16 bug-free and 7 buggy C programs, from the \textbf{recursive} category of the 2014 Competition on Software Verification~\cite{svcomp14}.
We compared our work with four participants of \cite{svcomp14}, including Blast~\cite{BeyerHJM07}, CBMC~\cite{}, Ultimate Automizer~\cite{HeizmannCDEHLNSP13}, and Ultimate Kojak~\cite{Kojak}. The latter three tools are the top three winners of the category this year.
Each tool was executed and evaluated under the same configuration and time limits(900 sec.) used in \cite{svcomp14}.
All experiments were conducted on a virtual machine with one 2.93GHz CPU and 4GB memory running 64-bit Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. The VM runs on a host machine with an Intel Core i7-870 Quad-Core CPU, 8GB memory, and 64-bit Win 7.
